## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

This project was built using HTML,CSS  JavaScript, and React. I was able to effectively implement components and utilize them to create a personal project that would allow me to not only speak about my skills but also display them as well.

## Optimizations



## Lessons Learned:

I was able to learn how to use components effectively when dealing with the React. Additionally, I was able to create these components and import them into my App.JS file in order render them onto the webpage.

Also, this is my first time not having to use the entire screen for a project and so I was able to use a few new CSS skills as well.
## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
